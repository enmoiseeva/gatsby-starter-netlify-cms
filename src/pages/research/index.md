    - title: Using ATR and WEE1 inhibitors to induce origin firing
      text: >
        Inhibition of ATR or WEE1 kinase activity results in excessive dormant
        origin firing in S-phase cells through hyperactivation of CDK1 and CDK2
        kinases. This gives us a unique opportunity to study replication
        initiation.
    - title: Using split-TurboID for proteomic screens
      text: TurboID is an optimized biotin ligase for proximity labelling, and
        splitting it in two inactive halves of the protein allows us to study
        the formation of replication complex and the transient components
        involved in this process.
    - title: Using auxin-inducible degrons for rapid knockdowns to replication
        proteins
      text: Replication proteins are notoriously difficult to study, largely due to
        the fact that their knockouts are lethal, and knockdowns have severe
        effects on the cell cycle. Transient knockdowns with mAID system allows
        us to study the roles of these proteins more easily.

    - title: New components
      text: >
        We are using a combination of proteomic approaches to identify new
        players in human replication initiation.
    - title: Critical interactions
      text: We are studying the roles of non-catalytic replisome components in
        replication complex assembly and origin firing.
    - title: Signaling
      text: We are identifying the specific roles and substrates of cell cycle kinases
        in S-phase entry and replication initiation.
