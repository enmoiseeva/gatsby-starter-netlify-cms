text_block2: <p>I did a Master's in Microbiology, where I studied poxvirus-host
  interactions and developed a method for recombinant vaccinia virus generation.
  My PhD project will be focused on the roles that the protein Timeless plays in
  the initiation of DNA replication in human cells.</p>
text_block3: <p>I&nbsp;have completed my&nbsp;MSc in&nbsp;Biochemistry from the
  University of&nbsp;Kashmir. My&nbsp;recent project was to&nbsp;develop
  a&nbsp;high-throughput screening technology to&nbsp;identify molecular
  inhibitors of&nbsp;fibroblast activation. Using this technology,
  we&nbsp;intended to&nbsp;discover molecules that specifically target the
  epicenter of&nbsp;fibroblast activation pathways, involved in&nbsp;the
  development of&nbsp;tissue fibrosis. Currently, I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;Ph.D. student
  working on&nbsp;the topic of&nbsp;identification of&nbsp;new players
  in&nbsp;replication initiation.</p>

​I have started my independent research in the Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Tallinn University of Technology, in August 2019. My research interests include the investigation of the initiation in DNA replication in human cells. During my postdoctoral training I have studied the effects of ATR inhibition in DNA replication initiation and discovered a mechanism of dormant origin suppression in the absence of DNA damage.
