text_block3: <p>I&nbsp;have completed my&nbsp;MSc in&nbsp;Biochemistry from the
  University of&nbsp;Kashmir. My&nbsp;recent project was to&nbsp;develop
  a&nbsp;high-throughput screening technology to&nbsp;identify molecular
  inhibitors of&nbsp;fibroblast activation. Using this technology,
  we&nbsp;intended to&nbsp;discover molecules that specifically target the
  epicenter of&nbsp;fibroblast activation pathways, involved in&nbsp;the
  development of&nbsp;tissue fibrosis. Currently, I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;Ph.D. student
  working on&nbsp;the topic of&nbsp;identification of&nbsp;new players
  in&nbsp;replication initiation.</p><p><a

text_block4: <p>I&nbsp;pursued my&nbsp;master&rsquo;s degree in&nbsp;Cellular
  and Molecular Oncology with a&nbsp;thesis on&nbsp;the role of&nbsp;miRNA
  in&nbsp;oral carcinogenesis. My&nbsp;most recent studies focused
  on&nbsp;delineating the role of&nbsp;a&nbsp;microcephaly linked gene
  in&nbsp;cancer. Understanding this could aid in&nbsp;identifying new germline
  associated cancer biomarkers, and the development of&nbsp;new drugs that
  target cancer cell division. In&nbsp;my&nbsp;current lab, I&nbsp;work
  on&nbsp;the cancer-associated variants of&nbsp;various replication
  proteins.</p><p><a

text_block5: <p>I am a PhD student in the Oncology Graduate Program at Hillman
  Cancer Center. My research interest is primarily in genetics and genome
  instability, and through my PhD project I will study DNA replication,
  specifically focusing on the roles of DNA Polymerase Epsilon. In 2024 I
  completed a Biology BS degree with a minor in chemistry from Temple
  University, where I studied calcium ion signaling in melanoma.</p><p><a

As an Assistant Professor at the University of Pittsburgh and UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, my research interests include the investigation of the initiation in DNA replication in human cells, which is both an important basic science question and can help us fight cancer. ​I have started my independent research in the Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Tallinn University of Technology, in August 2019,  and moved to Pittsburgh in early 2024.
