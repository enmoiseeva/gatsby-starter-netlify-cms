  University of&nbsp;Kashmir. My&nbsp;recent project was to&nbsp;develop
  a&nbsp;high-throughput screening technology to&nbsp;identify molecular
  inhibitors of&nbsp;fibroblast activation. Using this technology,
  we&nbsp;intended to&nbsp;discover molecules that specifically target the
  epicenter of&nbsp;fibroblast activation pathways, involved in&nbsp;the
  development of&nbsp;tissue fibrosis. Currently, I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;Ph.D. student

text_block4: <p>I&nbsp;pursued my&nbsp;master&rsquo;s degree in&nbsp;Cellular and Molecular Oncology with a&nbsp;thesis on&nbsp;the role of&nbsp;miRNA in&nbsp;oral carcinogenesis. My&nbsp;most recent studies focused on&nbsp;delineating the role of&nbsp;a&nbsp;microcephaly linked gene in&nbsp;cancer. Understanding this could aid in&nbsp;identifying new germline associated cancer biomarkers, and the development of&nbsp;new drugs that target cancer cell division. In&nbsp;my&nbsp;current lab, I&nbsp;work on&nbsp;the cancer-associated variants of&nbsp;various replication proteins.</p><p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raviteja-Chavata" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResearchGate</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/ravitejachavata" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9679-0785" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ORCID</a></p>

​I have started my independent research in the Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Tallinn University of Technology, in August 2019. My research interests include the investigation of the initiation in DNA replication in human cells. During my postdoctoral training I have studied the effects of ATR inhibition in DNA replication initiation and discovered a mechanism of dormant origin suppression in the absence of DNA damage.
